# SelfLearning
Online diary to learn machine learning materials and projects applying models  
There are so many resources online to learn machine learning and updated model. It is so difficult to choose the help and learn efficiently. Then I start recording my learning progress, which can keep me on track and encourage me. Finally, it can inspire others on the learning road. 
This repository contains all the resources I used for self-learning, including the basic foundation math and statistic theory, neural network unit, and meaningful models, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields.

I follow some people, they offer excellent resources online, and mostly are free. Many thanks to them. You can find any resource you need in machine learning area.
